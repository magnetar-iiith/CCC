## TL;DR
This paper presents several foundational results for combinatorial civic crowdfunding. Given budget-constrained agents, we argue that it may be desirable to fund the welfare optimal subset. We prove that under specific assumption on the overall budget and agents' individual budget, the optimal subset is funded at equilibrium. For any other scenario, an agent may have an incentive to deviate from funding the optimal set. However, we show that computing the optimal deviation in the multi-project case is NP-Hard.
